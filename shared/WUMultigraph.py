"""
A weighted undirected multigraph implementation in pure python.

Graphs have nodes connected by edges. The edges have a "weight" attached to
them. We use a combination of a hashmap and direct map to keep track of
arbitrary hashable node values and their corresponding natural number id.

We implement the following interface:
set_edge(u: any, v: any, w: float) -> None : sets weight w from node u to v.
get_edge(u: any, v: any) -> float : gets weight w from node u to v.
get_outdegree(u: any) -> int : gets number of nodes pointing from u.

To keep track of the nodes and edges, we use an adjacency list implementation.
This scheme works best when the graph is relatively sparse. For every node,
we have a list of outgoing edges, which are stored as pairs of [target, weight].
Unfortunately, this makes get_indegree quite slow as we have to search
all the other adjacency lists, so we do not implement it.
